Thanks, Gillian, for the below as well as for the event on Monday - always great to partner together. Please see a proposed version below with some update suggestions from me. Also including a picture I took which captures more of the room and you may wish to use. We will put out a similar post as well....

As part of the @Optimal People CPO Accelerate programme earlier this week we had the privilege of hearing @Andrew Rashbass and @Elie Rashbass, Chair and CEO of @ScultureAI, talk about 'Demystifying AI for HR' 

It was a fascinating session which inspired and challenged our thinking about what AI means for us today - and in the future.

Andrew's key message was to think about AI beyond just efficiency gains, but rather how HR and People teams can now use AI to completely transform an organisation. By leaning into the opportunity, they can solve critical problems that were never before possible. In the case of ScultureAI, HR leaders can now drive performance at scale by embedding the culture they know they want but couldn't scale and sustain. It also opens up new frontiers and possibilities in recruitment, onboarding and even alumni engagement.

Human leadership in organisations with the evolution of AI is core to what we do at Optimal People. Reach out to leaern more.

We talked about everything frompersonalised onboarding opportunities through to xxxxx (Elie pls add in a few other examples)? We also talked about the importance of the human leadership element in organisations with the evolution of AI - something that is core to what we do at Optimal People.Then add hashtags Thx! Sent from Outlook for iOS
