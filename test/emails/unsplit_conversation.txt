Thanks, James, and likewise good to speak last week. Congrats again on the new move/venture, and thanks for sharing the article.

Would be great to meet Hariolf and Maja on the w/c 29th - please see some proposed times below that myself and Jamie can meet in person, either at your Kings Cross office or in our Camden town office.  Let us know if any of these are convenient.

Monday 29th: 845-945am, 1230-130pm
Tuesday 30th: 5-6pm
Friday 3rd: 830-930, 12-1pm

Would also be good to reconnect with Ben and Iain. As mentioned, Jamie is leading on our commercial functions so most important that he is there, but I will join as well if I can. Looking at diaries, Thursday 1230-2 this week works if that is good for you also?

Thanks and best wishes,

Elie

Hi Elie Good to speak to you last week. 
 As promised, I’d like to arrange for you to meet with Hariolf Wenzler (YPOG CEO) and Maja Gartner (YPOG Head of People) when they are in the UK w/c 29th Sept. to
 demo the produce and see how we may be able to work with you with a pilot study.  Are there days that work better for you that week? In the meantime, I think it would be helpful to arrange a catch up with Ben Williams, Iain Cockburn and me this week if you have time.  I have gaps Wednesday and Thursday if
 that could work for you? And by way of background to the move, here is the Press Release announcing the recent launch. 
Ex-Withers group launches London
 office for German tech law firm - The Global Legal Post As to what our move means for Scutlure.ai??  It is my firm belief that your business is in way better hands with us here than we were at Withers.  Not only are we are working
 on a better platform, but we are optimising efficiencies in our service delivery through the active development and use of tech, and our primary (not peripheral) focus is on supporting the best European technology companies as they grow. I do hope we can continue
 to work together. Best James
