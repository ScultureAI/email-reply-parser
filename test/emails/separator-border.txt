As part of the @COMPANY_A CPO Accelerate programme earlier this week, we had the privilege of hearing @SPEAKER_A and
@SPEAKER_B, Chair and CEO of @COMPANY_B, talk about 'Demystifying AI for HR'. If you haven't already, worth exploring WEBSITE and
following their LinkedIn page to learn more about AI and how they are using it to help companies turn the culture they aspire to into everyday
behaviours.
It was a fascinating session that both inspired and challenged our thinking about what AI means for us today
–
and in the future.
One of SPEAKER_A's key messages was to think about AI as more than just automation and efficiency gains. HR and People teams can now use AI
to completely transform an organisation and unlock possibilities never before achievable – positioning HR as the driving force behind change.
By leaning into this opportunity AI presents, HR can solve critical problems, be that in culture (like COMPANY_B), workforce planning, recruitment,
onboarding, L&D and even alumni engagement.
Human leadership in organisations with the evolution of AI is core to what we do at COMPANY_A. Reach out to learn more.
