Hi Ellie, Hopefully we can find a time to reconnect soon once you have had a chance to
speak with your VP People.
In the meantime, I'd love to personally invite you and your VP People to the Business
Culture Connected Conference on Thursday 25th September in London. It's a free, half-day
event for senior HR, L&D and business leaders on how we can transform organisations for
the future of work. The afternoon will bring together leading thinkers and practitioners to
network and explore: Upskilling and reskilling our workforce - preparing for the future of
work AI & Robotics - driving innovation and productivity Cu
