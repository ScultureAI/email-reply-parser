Thanks, Gillian, for the below post as well as for the event on Monday - always great to partner together.
Please see a proposed updated version below with some suggestions for you to consider.
Also including a picture I took which captures more of the room that you may wish to use.
We will put out a similar post as well.
Let me know what you think.

As part of the @Optimal People CPO Accelerate programme earlier this week, we had the privilege of hearing @Andrew Rashbass and
@Elie Rashbass, Chair and CEO of @ScultureAI, talk about 'Demystifying AI for HR'. If you haven't already, worth exploring sculture.ai and
following their LinkedIn page to learn more about AI and how they are using it to help companies turn the culture they aspire to into everyday
behaviours.
It was a fascinating session that both inspired and challenged our thinking about what AI means for us today
–
and in the future.
One of Andrew's key messages was to think about AI as more than just automation and efficiency gains. HR and People teams can now use AI
to completely transform an organisation and unlock possibilities never before achievable – positioning HR as the driving force behind change.
By leaning into this opportunity AI presents, HR can solve critical problems, be that in culture (like ScultureAI), workforce planning, recruitment,
onboarding, L&D and even alumni engagement.
Human leadership in organisations with the evolution of AI is core to what we do at Optimal People. Reach out to learn more.
